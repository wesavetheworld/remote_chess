1. OVERVIEW
===========

REMOTE CHESS is a web platform for playing chess via e-mail or instant
messenger. Every state of a game is represented by a URL, saving the game is
done by bookmarking the page. Players receive a link, enter their move and send
the resulting link back to their chess partners, so they can continue the game.

The benefit of this system is, that the users have maximum control over their
data without the need to identify themselves on the server. The program can be
used in text browsers linke links2 or lynx and is meant to be very simple.

Using this program makes more sense with E-Mail, because instant messengers
tend to induce speedy exchange of moves. This may cause copy/pasting becoming
too frequent and annoying.


2. INSTALLING
=============

Copy all files into a folder in your web space.

You may have to enable PHP. Also, directory requests like xy.com/chess/?params
should be handled by  index.php , which will likely be the default.

Since short tags are deprecated, you can either set
	php_value short_open_tag 1
or replace all instances of  <?= STUFF ?>  with  <?php echo STUFF ?> .

There is a bunch of options in  definitions.php .


3. FILES
========
index.php           - Include all files, call main_control(), HTML template
helpers.php         - Conversions
definitions.php     - Settings, constants
movement_rules.php  - See, what moves a piece can do
url_helpers.php     - Manipulate the GET parameters of a link
generate_markup.php - Create HTML for the chess board, game's history, etc.
game_logic.php      - main_control() - Handle any input in one huge function

icons_white.png, icons_black.png - CSS sprites for each player.


4. MODE OF OPERATION
====================

SOME DEFINITIONS
----------------
A chess board is divided into rows ("Ranks" 1 to 8) and columns ("Files" A to H).
The bottom left field (for White) is named A1, right to it is B1, a.s.o.
Fields A1 and H8 (bottom left for each player) have a dark color, A8 and H1 are
colored brightly. In this case, the rule applies: "White queen to white field,
black queen to black field". See diagram below.

PROGRAM FLOW
------------
After  index.php  is loaded, it immediately includes all other PHP files and
calls the main program in  game_logic.php:main_control() . After it is finished
and returns to  index.php , the results (global variables) are used to build the
markup for the page, mainly a table and a list of history entries.

The main function is very long and described in more detail below. According to
the given parameters, a specific game state is assumed and executed:

MAIN ACTIONS
* New game (when called without GET parameters, asks for player names)
* Select a piece of the current player
* Select a field to move a piece to
* Promote a pawn that reached the top of the board

SECONDARY ACTIONS
* Flip board            ?flip
* Switch player         ?player=<white|black>
* Clear board           ?base=   (Empty)
* Create/Remove piece   Editor: from=<piece code>, to=<field name>
                        To remove a piece, you must name the correct piece code

GAME STATE STORAGE
------------------
The complete game state is being stored in the very link of the page. This is
done using the GET parameters:

	&player=<white|black>
	&history=<coded list of moves>
	&white=<Name of white player>
	&black=<Name of black player>
	&enpassant=<file name>

Example: starting board, encoded:
	  'SaNbBcQdLeBfNgSh'   // Row 1, A1..H1
	. 'PiPjPkPlPmPnPoPp'   // 2
	. 'pWpXpYpZp0p1p2p3'   // 7
	. 's4n5b6q7l8b9n*s$'   // 8


FUNCTION main_control()
-----------------------
The main program consists of several sections, which can roughly be divided
into:
	* Initialization
	* Fetch GET parameters
	* Build  $board_array  from  &base=  and/or  $history .
	* Analyse  from  and  to  and execute
		* EDITOR
		* COMMAND
		* MOVE
		* SELECT/DESELECT
	* Create  $href_this  (Adding GET parameters describing current state)
	* Possible redirection (in order to make the URL nicer)
	* Building markup
	* Set  $heading  and  $game_title , if
	* Set a default  $game_title , if none given
	* Create  $game_state_link  (The link that is sent to the other player)


MOVING A PIECE (HTTP Redirect)
------------------------------
When  from  and  to  contain valid field names and the move is possible, it
will be applied to the current  $board_array  and the move is added to the
history. To get rid of the GET parameters  from  and  to ,  $redirect_after_move
is set in order to trigger the according actions later in  main_control() .


CASTLING
--------
Rooks and kings are initially coded as  S, L  or  s, l  indicating, that they
have not yet been moved. The code will be switched to  R, K  or  r, k  in
apply_move(), preventing them from being considered for castling.


EN PASSANT
----------
When a pawn is moved two ranks on its first move, the other player may be
allowed to capture that pawn en passant, but only immediately after the pawn
was moved. A special GET parameter  &enpassant=<file name>  indicates the file
of the pawn that moved 2 ranks in the move before.


PROMOTING A PAWN
----------------
When a pawn reaches the top, the redirect that would be triggered by this MOVE
action is supressed, which results in a pawn promotion menu to be shown instead.
Selecting a replacement will trigger a "normal" move with a redirect.
